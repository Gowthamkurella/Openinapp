# Openinapp
The backend assignment project for OpeninApp is a comprehensive system that addresses task and subtask management, along with automation and notification capabilities. At its core, it features a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, enabling CRUD operations for tasks and subtasks, complete with authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The project incorporates two crucial cron jobs: one for dynamically updating task priorities based on due dates, and another for making voice calls using Twilio's API to notify users about overdue tasks. The voice calling functionality intelligently prioritizes users based on their assigned levels, ensuring timely notifications are delivered efficiently. The project showcases a strong grasp of backend development principles, API design, database integration, and the ability to leverage third-party services seamlessly.
